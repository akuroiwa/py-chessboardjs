# Data Model: Fix Engine Concurrency Error

**Feature**: Fix Engine Concurrency Error

This feature is an architectural refactoring to solve a concurrency issue. It does not introduce any changes to the application's data model.

The existing entities remain the same:

- **Game**: Represents the state of the chess match.
- **Move**: Represents a move made by a player.

No new data entities, fields, or relationships are being introduced.
