# Feature Specification: Fix Engine Concurrency Error

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-engine-concurrency`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Investigate and fix concurrent.futures.CancelledError during engine moves."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Application Stability Under Concurrent Operations (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the application to remain stable and not crash when I perform UI actions (like resetting the board or navigating move history) at the same time the chess engine is thinking.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical bug fix addressing the root cause of application instability. Without it, the application is unreliable and prone to crashing during normal use.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by running an automated script that plays a game while simultaneously and randomly triggering UI actions that interact with the engine lifecycle. The test passes if the application completes the script without crashing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chess engine is calculating a move, **When** the user clicks the 'Reset Board' button, **Then** the engine calculation is gracefully cancelled, the board is reset, and the application remains responsive.
2. **Given** the chess engine is calculating a move, **When** the user navigates backward or forward in the move history, **Then** the engine calculation is gracefully cancelled, the board displays the new position, and the application remains responsive.

### Edge Cases

- Rapidly clicking multiple UI buttons that all trigger `on_closed()` while the engine is thinking.
- Closing the application window while the engine is in the middle of a long calculation.
- The system running out of memory due to orphaned engine processes not being terminated correctly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The application MUST prevent or gracefully handle `concurrent.futures.CancelledError` exceptions that may occur during chess engine communication.
- **FR-002**: The lifecycle of the chess engine process (initialization, termination) MUST be managed in a thread-safe manner to prevent race conditions.
- **FR-003**: Any action that terminates the chess engine MUST ensure that any in-progress calculations are safely cancelled before the engine process is killed.
- **FR-004**: The application MUST remain responsive and in a consistent state even if an engine calculation is cancelled midway.
- **FR-005**: No zombie or orphaned chess engine processes should remain after the main application window is closed.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **`Api` class**: The Python object exposed to the `pywebview` frontend, which serves as the bridge for UI-to-backend communication.
- **`chess.engine.SimpleEngine`**: The wrapper for the external UCI chess engine process.
- **`concurrent.futures.Future`**: The object representing the asynchronous result of an engine calculation, which is the subject of the `CancelledError`.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Application Stability: Zero `concurrent.futures.CancelledError` or `chess.engine.EngineTerminatedError` exceptions result in an application crash during a test suite of 50 games with random, concurrent UI interactions.
- **SC-002**: Process Management: After closing the application, no orphaned `stockfish` (or other UCI engine) processes are left running. This can be verified with system process monitoring tools.
- **SC-003**: Responsiveness: The UI remains responsive (buttons are clickable, window is movable) even when the engine is under heavy load and UI actions are performed concurrently.
