# Feature Specification: Fix AttributeError in settings loading

**Feature Branch**: `001-fix-settings-load-error`
**Created**: 2025年10月24日
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix AttributeError in settings loading"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Application starts without crashing (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to start the application without it crashing, so I can use its features. The application currently fails on startup due to an error when loading settings.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical bug that prevents any use of the application.

**Independent Test**: The application can be launched. If it opens the main window, the test passes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is installed, **When** the user launches it, **Then** the main GUI window appears without any `AttributeError` in the logs.
2. **Given** a `settings.ini` file does not exist, **When** the user launches the application, **Then** a new `settings.ini` file is created with default values in the correct user directory, and the application starts successfully.
3. **Given** a valid `settings.ini` file exists, **When** the user launches the application, **Then** the application loads the settings from the file and starts successfully.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the `settings.ini` file is present but malformed or empty? The application should handle the error gracefully, use default settings, and ideally notify the user or log the error without crashing.
- What happens if the application lacks permissions to write to the configuration directory? It should use in-memory default settings for the session and log a warning.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The application MUST NOT crash on startup due to an `AttributeError` in the `load_settings` function.
- **FR-002**: If the `settings.ini` file does not exist, the system MUST create it with default values in the user's cache directory (`~/.cache/py-chessboardjs/settings.ini` on Linux).
- **FR-003**: If the `settings.ini` file exists, the system MUST load configuration from it.
- **FR-004**: If the `settings.ini` file is malformed or corrupted, the system MUST fall back to default settings and log an error. It MUST NOT crash.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Settings**: A collection of key-value pairs that configure the application's behavior (e.g., `uci_engine` path, `depth`). Stored in `settings.ini`.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The application startup success rate is 100%, with no crashes related to the `AttributeError`.
- **SC-002**: On first launch (when no config file exists), the `settings.ini` file is created and populated with default values within 1 second.
- **SC-003**: Changes made to the `settings.ini` file are correctly reflected in the application's behavior on the next launch.
